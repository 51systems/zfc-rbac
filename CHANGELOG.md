# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0

* ZfcRbac has been completely rewrite, with unit-testing in mind. A LOT of documentation has been written
to cover most use cases, from simple to more advanced use cases. It would be too long to describe all the
changes, so please refer to the official documentation.
* [BC] PHP dependency has been raised to PHP 5.4 (because we need to go forward). People that need compatibility
with PHP 5.3 can still use the 0.2 branch
* [BC] Zend Framework 2 dependency has been raised to 2.2.
