# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation of ZfcRbac!

In this part, you will learn:

* Why you should use an authorization module to protect your application.
* Learn what is the Rbac model.
* How ZfcRbac hooks up into your application.

## Why using an authorization module?

The authorization part of an application is an essential aspect to secure your application. While the authentication part tells you who is using your website, the authorization answers if the given identity has the permission to perform some actions.

## The Rbac model

Rbac stands for **role-based access control**. Zend Framework 2 offers a lightweight and very efficient implementation of this authorization model.

The basic idea of Rbac is to use roles and permissions:

* A role requests access to a permission. A role can have a parent role (so one role may have multiple children roles). One parent role automatically inherits the children roles' permissions.
* A permission is granted to a role.
* An identity can have one or more roles.

You can learn more about this in the [official Zend Framework 2 documentation](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.2/en/modules/zend.permissions.rbac.intro.html).

This is always clearer with a simple example. Let's say we create a forum application:

## How ZfcRbac integrates into your application?

ZfcRbac offers multiple ways to protect your application:

* Guards: those classes act as "firewalls" that unauthorize access to routes and/or controllers. Guards are usually configured using PHP arrays, and are executed early in the MVC dispatch process (typically, just after the route has been matched).
* Protecting your services: you can use the AuthorizationService directly in your services to protect them.

Most of the time, you will want to use both (but this is optional).
