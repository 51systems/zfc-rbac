This section will help you to further understand how ZfcRbac works by providing more concrete examples. If you have
any other recipe you'd like to add, please open an issue!

## Best practices

One mistake most beginners do is protecting their applications using guards only. In fact, you should protect all
your services by injecting the authorization service.

Let's say we are creating a blog module where only "admin" users are allowed to delete posts. We will likely have
a route "post/delete", a PostController and a PostService.

The PostController:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;

    public function deleteAction()
    {
        $id = $this->params()->fromQuery('id');
        $this->postService->deletePost($id);

        return $this->redirect()->toRoute('home'));
    }
}
```

And the PostService, that handles the logic of deleting the post:

```php
class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

And our ZfcRbac guard config that grants access to the route to admins only:

```php
return array(
    'zfc_rbac' => array(
        'guards' => array(
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => array(
                'post/delete' => array('admin')
            )
        )
    )
);
```

Now, any users that do not have the "admin" users will receive a 403 error (unauthorized) when trying to access
the "post/delete" route. Now, what if the "createAction" is written like this:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;

    public function createAction()
    {
        // MUHAHAHA DOING SOMETHING EVIL!!!
        $this->postService->deletePost('2');
    }
}
```

You see the issue! The solution is to inject the AuthorizationService into your services, and checking for the
permissions before doing anything wrong:

```php
class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;

    protected $authorizationService;

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        // First check permission
        if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost')) {
            throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
        }

        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

Of course, you have to configure a permission provider so that the Rbac container is aware of this permission. In
your config, add the following code:

```php
return array(
    'zfc_rbac' => array(
        'permission_providers' => array(
            'ZfcRbac\Permission\InMemoryPermissionProvider' => array(
                'deletePost'  => array('admin')
            )
        )
    )
);
```

For more information about permission providers, please refer to [this page](/docs/05. Permission providers.md).

### When using guards then?

In fact, you should see guards as a very efficient way to quickly reject access to a hierarchy of routes or a
whole controller. For instance, assuming you have the following route config:


```php
return array(
    'router' => array(
        'routes' => array(
            'admin' => array(
                'type'    => 'Literal',
                'options' => array(
                    'route' => '/admin'
                ),
                'may_terminate' => true,
                'child_routes' => array(
                    'users' => array(
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => array(
                            'route' => '/users'
                        )
                    ),
                    'invoices' => array(
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => array(
                            'route' => '/invoices'
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
);
```

You can quickly unauthorized access to all admin routes using the following guard:

```php
return array(
    'zfc_rbac' => array(
        'guards' => array(
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => array(
                'admin*' => array('admin')
            )
        )
    )
);
```

## Optimize for production

ZfcRbac is already quite efficient, but there are some ways to make it even faster.

### Use cache

ZfcRbac allows you to specify a cache for role and permission providers (especially useful for providers that load
data from database).

You can either specify a service key that is fetched from service manager (the returned cache must
implement `Zend\Cache\Storage\StorageInterface`):

```php
return array(
    'zfc_rbac' => array(
        'cache' => 'myCache'
    )
);
```

Or using a `Zend\Cache\Storage\StorageFactory::factory` compliant config:

```php
return array(
    'zfc_rbac' => array(
        'cache' => array(
            'adapter' => 'apc'
        )
    )
);
```
