This section will help you to further understand how ZfcRbac works by providing more concrete examples. If you have
any other recipe you'd like to add, please open an issue!

## A Real World Application

In this example we are going to create a very little real world application. We will create a controller
`PostController` that interacts with a service called `PostService`. For the sake of simplicity we will only
cover the `delete`-methods of both parts.

Let's start by creating a controller that has the `PostService` as dependency:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;

    public function __construct(PostService $postService)
    {
        $this->postService = $postService;
    }

    // addAction(), editAction(), etc...

    public function deleteAction()
    {
        $id = $this->params()->fromQuery('id');

        $this->postService->deletePost($id);

        return $this->redirect()->toRoute('posts');
    }
}
```

Since we have a dependency, let's inject it using the `ControllerManager`, we will do this inside our `Module`-Class

```php
class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...

    public function getControllerConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostController' => function($cpm) {
                     // We assume a Service key 'PostService' here that returns the PostService Class
                     return new PostController(
                         $cpm->getServiceLocator()->get('PostService')
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

Now that we got this in place let us quickly define our `PostService`. We will be using a Service that makes use
of Doctrine, so we require a `Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager` as dependency.

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;

    public function __construct(ObjectManager $objectManager)
    {
        $this->objectManager = $objectManager;
    }

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

And for this one, too, let's quickly create the factory, again within our `Module` class.

```php
class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...

    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostService' => function($sm) {
                     return new PostService(
                         $sm->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default')
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

With this set up we can now cover some best practices.

## Best practices

One mistake most beginners do is protecting their applications using guards only. This leaves your application open for
some undesired side-effects. As a best practice you should protect all your services by injecting the authorization
service. But let's go step by step:

Assuming the application example above we can easily use ZfcRbac to protect our route using the following guard:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'guards' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => [
                'post/delete' => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Now, any users that do not have the "admin" role will receive a 403 error (unauthorized) when trying to access
the "post/delete" route. However, this does not prevent the service (which should contain the actual logic in a properly
design application) to be injected and used elsewhere in your code. For instance:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;

    public function createAction()
    {
        // MUHAHAHA DOING SOMETHING EVIL!!!
        $this->postService->deletePost('2');
    }
}
```

You see the issue! The solution is to inject the `AuthorizationService` into your services, and checking for the
permissions before doing anything wrong. So let's modify our previously created `PostService`-class

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;

    protected $authorizationService;

    public function __construct(
        ObjectManager        $objectManager,
        AuthorizationService $autorizationService
    ) {
        $this->objectManager        = $objectManager;
        $this->authorizationService = $autorizationService;
    }

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        // First check permission
        if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost')) {
            throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
        }

        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

Since we now have an additional dependency we should inject it through our factory, again within our `Module` class.

```php
class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...

    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostService' => function($sm) {
                     return new PostService(
                         $sm->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default'),
                         $sm->get('ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationService') // This is new!
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

### When using guards then?

In fact, you should see guards as a very efficient way to quickly reject access to a hierarchy of routes or a
whole controller. For instance, assuming you have the following route config:

```php
return [
    'router' => [
        'routes' => [
            'admin' => [
                'type'    => 'Literal',
                'options' => [
                    'route' => '/admin'
                ],
                'may_terminate' => true,
                'child_routes' => [
                    'users' => [
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => [
                            'route' => '/users'
                        ]
                    ],
                    'invoices' => [
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => [
                            'route' => '/invoices'
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
};
```

You can quickly unauthorized access to all admin routes using the following guard:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'guards' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => [
                'admin*' => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Using dynamic assertions

Sometimes, using permissions alone is not enough. For instance, let's reuse the example for the previous part, more
specifically the `deletePost` method:

```php
public function deletePost($id)
{
    // First check permission
    if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost')) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
    }

    $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
    $this->objectManager->remove($post);
    $this->objectManager->flush();
}
```

This code protects your service so that only users that have the `admin` role can delete a post. However, this allows
*any* admin to delete *any* post. Instead, we want to make sure that only the admin author of a specific post can
delete its own post.

To handle this case, ZfcRbac allows you to specify assertions as the second argument of `isGranted` method. Assertions
can either be a callable (closure...) or any class that implements `ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionInterface`.

Each assertion gives you access to the current identity. Here is an example:

```php
public function deletePost($id)
{
    $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);

    $assertion = function(IdentityInterface $currentIdentity = null) use ($post) {
        return $currentIdentity === $post->getAuthor();
    };

    // First check permission
    if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost', $assertion)) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
    }

    $this->objectManager->remove($post);
    $this->objectManager->flush();
}
```

When using assertions, here is the worfklow:

1. It traverses each identity roles, and check if the role has the asked permission.
    1.1 If it has the permission, it checks the assertion: if the assertion returns true, then `isGranted` returns
    true also, otherwise it returns `false`
2. If none of the identity roles have the permission, it returns false (and the assertion is never evaluated).

You must see the assertion as a second-pass validation that is executed ONLY when a role has a permission.

## Using ZfcRbac with Doctrine ORM

TBD

## How to deal with roles with lot of permissions?

In very complex applications, your roles may have dozens of permissions. In the [/data/FlatRole.php.dist] entity
we provide, we configure the permissions association so that whenever a role is loaded, all its permissions are also
loaded in one query (notice the `fetch="EAGER"`):

```php
/**
  * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity="Permission", indexBy="name", fetch="EAGER")
  */
protected $permissions;
```

The `hasPermission` method is therefore really simple:

```php
public function hasPermission($permission)
{
    return isset($this->permissions[(string) $permission]);
}
```

However, with a lot of permissions, this method will quickly kill your database. What you can do is modfiy the Doctrine
mapping so that the collection is not actually loaded:

```php
/**
  * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity="Permission", indexBy="name", fetch="LAZY")
  */
protected $permissions;
```

Then, modify the `hasPermission` method to use the Criteria API. The Criteria API is a Doctrine 2.2+ API that allows
to efficiently filter a collection without loading the whole collection:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Criteria;

public function hasPermission($permission)
{
    $criteria = Criteria::create()->where(Criteria::expr()->eq('name', (string) $permission));
    $result   = $this->permissions->matching($criteria);

    return count($result) > 0;
}
```

> NOTE: Doctrine ORM does not yet support usage of Criteria API on ManyToMany associations. However, I've made
a PR [here](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/pull/885) that brings support for that. Hopefully this will be
merged for Doctrine 2.5!

## Using ZfcRbac and ZF2 Assetic

To use [Assetic](https://github.com/widmogrod/zf2-assetic-module) with ZfcRbac guards, you should modify your
`module.config.php` using the following configuration:

```php
return [
    'assetic_configuration' => [
        'acceptableErrors' => [
            \ZfcRbac\Guard\GuardInterface::GUARD_UNAUTHORIZED
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Using ZfcRbac and ZfcUser

To use the authentication service from ZfcUser, just add the following alias in your application.config.php:

```php
return [
    'service_manager' => [
        'aliases' => [
            'Zend\Authentication\AuthenticationService' => 'zfcuser_auth_service'
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Using Initializers

You can use initializers to inject the AuthenticationService. All you need to do is for your class to implement `ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationServiceAwareInterface`.
An implementation is already provided by `ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationServiceAwareTrait`.

The initializer is deactivated by default. To use it add

```
'service_manager' => [
	'initializers' => [
	    'ZfcRbac\Initializer\AuthorizationServiceInitializer'   
	]
]
```        

to your `module.config.php`.
